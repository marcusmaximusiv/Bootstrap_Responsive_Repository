                    My name is Mark Sterrenberg. I am currently a software engineer for AT&T and have been taking the class
                    to improve my coding skills to eventually move onto the higher role in my career. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    I took this class to allow me to learn both front end and back end to get to my goal of being a full stack developer. 
                    SMU Coding Bootcamp has helped to do that and so much more on my journey to becoming a fullstack developer
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    I have learned so much thus far and hope to bring my skills to new heights with this class. No words can describe how
                    amazing this class is. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Thank you SMU Bootcamp for teaching me so much about programming in such a short time. The instructor and TAs
                    are awesome so Thank you guys!
